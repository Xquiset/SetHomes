# SetHomes
A simple homes plugin with the ability to create, delete, and teleport to many different homes. Have the ability to control a blacklist of worlds in which players will be restricted from setting homes. Using the config you can control setting such as a maximum number of homes, teleport cooldown, teleport delay, and their respective messages that get display to the user.

# Installation
Simply place the downloaded jar into your server plugins folder.
**NOTE! For "MAX HOMES" to work you must meet one of the soft dependencies below, and setup groups for the respective permissions plugin. You will then also need to setup max-homes in the config.yml. An example max-homes setup can be found below the default config**

# Soft Dependencies
- [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/download)
- [Vault plugin](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/vault), as well as, a permissions plugin supported by Vault

# Commands
- **/sethome [HomeName] [HomeDescription]** - This command will allow the issuer to set a home with a given name and description of their choosing at your standing location. If no name and description are given then you will set a default home at your standing location.
- **/home [HomeName]** - This command will teleport the user to the given "HomeName". If no home name is given then the user is teleported to their default set by **/sethome**
- **/home-of [PlayerName] [HomeName]** - This command will allow players with the "homes.home-of" permission to teleport to any players set home. If no home name is provided it will assume the default home as the desired destination.
- **/delhome [HomeName]** - This command will delete the home at the given home name. If no home name is given then it will attempt to remove the default home.
- **/delhome-of [PlayerName] [HomeName]** - This command will allow players with the "homes.delhome-of" permission to delete any players set home. If no home name is given it will assume the default home as the home desired for deletion.
- **/uhome [HomeName] [HomeDescription]** - This command will allow players with the "homes.uhome-of" permission to update a home for any player. If no home name is supplied then it will update the supplied players default home.
- **/uhome-of [PlayerName] [HomeName]** - This command will list all of the players currently set homes if there are any. Players with the "home.gethomes" permission can use the extra PlayerName parameter to list the homes of a specific player.
- **/homes [PlayerName]** - This command will list all of the players currently set homes if there are any. Players with the "home.gethomes" permission can use the extra PlayerName parameter to list the homes of a specific player.
- **/blacklist [Add/Remove] [WorldName]** - This command is used to manipulate the world blacklist. If a worlds name is in the blacklist then no players will be allowed to set homes in that world. Type /blacklist to list all worlds in the blacklist
- **/setmax [GroupName] [Amount]** - This command will allow players with the "homes.setmax" permission to set a maximum number of allowed homes for a specific permission group. For example if you wanted to only allow the default permission group 4 homes you execute the command, "/setmax default 4".

# F.A.Q
- **Q: How can I give players permission to set named homes?**
  **A:** You will need to install a permission plugin, either [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/download) or [Vault](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/vault) & a Vault supported permissions plugin then apply the permission "homes.sethome" to the (player/group) you would like to allow the usage of multiple homes for.
